# 🌐 Full-Stack Node.js Web Application

This is a modular and scalable full-stack web application built with **Node.js**, following a clean project architecture that separates concerns using **controllers**, **routes**, **models**, and **utilities**. The application includes cloud configuration, middleware, and dynamic views for rendering UI.
